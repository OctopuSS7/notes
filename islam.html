  <h1>The religion of Islam in Britain is struggling to express itself truly. Discuss.</h1>

A right to freedom of expression and religious belief is protected by law. Religion can be expressed in many ways such as clothes, symbols, the written word, speech and actions. Together, these create the outward expression of an inner faith.
<br><br>
Does Islam have one voice with which to express itself? There is no centralised authority in Islam. It is a multistranded religion, with many sects, such as Sunni and Shi’a, and even more subsects. Does ‘being a Muslim’ mean the same thing to all?
<br><br>
Whilst the Muslim council of Britain did for a period of time purport to represent the Muslim community in Britain, at least to the Government, there is no longer one representational voice, but a wide spectrum of varied Islamic views.
<br><br>
Does being British mean the same thing to all? The concept of national identity changed as power was devolved from Westminster to Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, leaving the concept of ‘Englishness’ stranded, which manifested itself, to some extent, in the referendum vote for Brexit.
<br><br>
Two responses have emerged among the Islamic community in Britain as to how they should engage with their country. The more moderate strand of British Islam has tried to integrate itself into British society, emphasising commonality. The more conservative approach has asserted its own largely separate identity, challenging British society tolerate difference. 
<br><br>
Does British society allow individuals to feel both British and Muslim at the same time? Where society has tended towards Islamophobia or more moderate forms of intolerance, British Muslims have often been more reticent in expressing their true identity. Britain has a national religion (Christianity), so it may sometimes be difficult for people of other religious to truly express themselves.
<br><br>
In conclusion, with quite fluid, fractured and ambiguous concepts of both Islam and Britain, it is no wonder that being a British Muslim is a complex question of identity dilemma.
