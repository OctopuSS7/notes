    <h1>DAVID HUME - Theory of Knowledge</h1>

    <br>
    David Hume was a member of the Scottish Enlightenment, and a close friend of Adam Smith (whose thinking led to free
    market economics). Hume was born in Edinburgh in 1711, and died in 1776. He attended the University of Edinburgh
    from 1721 to 1725, but did not complete a degree. For most of his life, he was an independent scholar and writer,
    often known as a public intellectual. His first book, “A Treatise of Human Nature” (1740), was not well received,
    although now it is considered one of his most influential works. This may have been in part due to his skepticism of
    religion as expressed within the book, which might also explain the two university positions that he was denied. He
    was also challenging a major part of the Enlightenment, which emphasised “the sovereignty of reason” by his idea
    that we are motivated by emotion and feeling more than rationality. However, Hume did agree with many aspects of the
    Enlightenment, such as skepticism and separation of the church and state.

    In his thinking on the theory of knowledge, also known as epistemology, Hume distinguished between relations of
    ideas and matters of fact. A statement such as ‘a square has four equal sides’ must be true in all circumstances,
    and Hume called this a ‘Relation of Ideas’. Such statements are derived from definition, or from thought alone, and
    we know them through understanding. In contrast, a statement such as ‘it is a sunny day’ may not be true in all
    circumstances, for example when it is cloudy, and Hume called this a ‘Matter of Fact’. These statements can only be
    proved through observation, and are only known to be true at the time of observation, however we can learn about
    Matters of Fact through induction and inference. Hume stated that if statements have denials which are conceivable
    and not contradictory, then mere thought is not enough to know that they are true. This idea had major consequences
    for religion, as Hume believed that religion wasn’t based on reason (as there was no rational reason the believe in
    a deity), and therefore couldn’t be argued for or against on the basis of facts.
